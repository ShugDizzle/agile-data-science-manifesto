# Agile Data Manifesto

## Front Page

Is the Agile Manifesto plus the following

Building a product over being academic

Working software over proofs of concepts

Computational methods over statistical tricks

Automation over interactive analysis

Clear evaluation over complex models

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Twelve Principles



Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of data driven
insights and actions that are entirely automated and
independent of the creator.

Data Science without automation and software principles is
not Data Science, it is a glorification of traditional Analytics with
open source technology.

Deliver automated data driven insights frequently, from a
week to a couple of weeks, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

A Data Scientist does not exist as an individual, they can only
exist as a member of a Data Science team that includes a wide set
of skills including Engineers, Developers, DevOps and Theorists.

All members of a Data Science team should
provide input to all areas of development and over
time learn all the skills to some degree.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Even in Data Science. Documentation, presentations and notebooks
come second.

Prototypes and "Proofs of Concept" should be avoided or
easily modifiable into production ready solutions.  Time should
not be wasted rewriting the same solution in different languages.

Evaluation of a model must be designed prior to building a model, they should be robust and high quality modules.  Without such a process we have Data Art.

The proven practices of Software Development are
applicable to Data Science, like Continuous Integration and
Test Driven Development. Rejection of this is either elitism, snobbery or laziness.

Simple models that clearly represent the business use case tend
to perform as well, and if not better than, complex models. The meaning and evaluation of the model should be in business terms over academic terms.

Use the use case and simple business numbers like profit and savings to evaluate models
over obscure statistics.

Avoid assuming you have a can opener, use the data to derive your insights
and use computational power to solve the difficulties rather than statistical tricks.
