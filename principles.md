## Twelve Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of data driven insights and actions that are entirely automated and independent of the creator.

2. Data Science without automation and software principles is not Data Science, it is a glorification of traditional Analytics with open source technology.

3. Deliver automated data driven insights frequently, from a week to a couple of weeks, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. A Data Scientist does not exist as an individual, they can only exist as a member of a Data Science team that includes a wide set of skills including Engineers, Developers, DevOps and Theorists.

5. All members of a Data Science team should provide input to all areas of development and over
time learn all the skills to some degree.

6. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Even in Data Science. Documentation, presentations and notebooks come second.

7. Prototypes and "Proofs of Concept" should be avoided or easily modifiable into production ready solutions.  Time should not be wasted rewriting the same solution in different languages.

8. Evaluation of a model must be designed prior to building a model, they should be robust and high quality modules.  Without such a process we have Data Art.

9. The proven practices of Software Development are applicable to Data Science, like Continuous Integration and
Test Driven Development. Rejection of this is either elitism, snobbery or laziness.

10. Simple models that clearly represent the business use case tend to perform as well, and if not better than, complex models. The meaning and evaluation of the model should be in business terms over academic terms.

11. Use the use case and simple business numbers like profit and savings to evaluate models over obscure statistics.

12. Avoid assuming you have a can opener, use the data to derive your insights and use computational power to solve the difficulties rather than statistical tricks.
